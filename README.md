# SWEN225_Project
## Chapâ€™s Challenge 

## Introduction

Design and implement a program for a single-player graphical adventure game using only the tools available in the Java standard library. The objective of the game is to explore an imaginary world, collecting objects, solving puzzles, and performing actions to complete the game. This project will bring together all of the techniques you have been taught thus far.

## How To Play
Start the game by running `nz.ac.vuw.ecs.swen225.a3.application.Main` from Eclipse. 
IntelliJ can also be used, but it is not recommended, and may carry additional complications.
Record can be started from the menu and will end when a level is lost/won, or the program is quit/save.
Replay can be started from the menu and will step through 1 sec per movement. To step through at own speed, pause replay using spacebar and use left and right arrow keys to step through. To start automatic replay again, press space.
Both levels 1 and 2 use plugins.
